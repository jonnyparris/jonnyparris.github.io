Tech blog started to help give back to the coding community and provide a space to track and reflect on various projects.

Please feel free to get in touch with any feedback, questions, suggestions or corrections to any of the content. Or, if you're just having a [general stalk](http://about.me/ruskin) then let me know what you think if we ever meet in person.

## Local start
