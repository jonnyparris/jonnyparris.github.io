### Memorable
* Topher lectured on building Sinatra apps from scratch
* Paired with Jay
* Went to Grove for dinner, super yummy

### Learned
* echo vs cat in bash
* lots more...

### Feels
Driven.

I had the realisation today that phase 2 is supposed to be grounding us with muscle-memory type knowledge that will be our "bread and butter" of web developement.
Bearing that in mind, there is simply no room for just hacking together solutions to the challenges in this phase. Each hurdle deserves proper attention and research because they are likely to resurface again and again in our careers. It's better to get frustrated with them now than in a job interview.
