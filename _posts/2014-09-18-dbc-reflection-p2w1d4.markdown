### Memorable
* Testing *ALL DAY*
* Sweet lunch at Grove with a crew
* Talk from Daniel Kehoe
* Chatted with Patrick
* Managed to turn corners on Topher's Airwheel

### Learned
* Testing controllers and models with Rspec
* Testing views and routes with capybara
* Practial AGILE group coding tips

### Feels
Today was blundersome lesson in testing that started with a lot of frustration but eventually led to some enlightenment.
Testing is tough because you have to be able to rely on solid test syntax in order to really benefit from the peace of mind that it should grant you when developing or refactoring.
