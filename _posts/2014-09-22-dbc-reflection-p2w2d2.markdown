### Memorable
* Chipotle lunch with Stu +co
* JS Orange Tree with Becca

### Learned
* Introduced to js testing with Jasmine
* Brief explanation of password hash salting from David
* Don't mix with jquery with javascript on the same line
* MVC patterns in JS

### Feels
Vaguely concerned about not catching up on all the portfolio projects before the end of the week so that I have enough time for the big P10 project...which I'm also a bit worried about finding an exciting idea to flesh out.

JS DOM manipulation so far has been a bit boring after the intitial teething pains with syntax and common gotchas.
I'm far more interested in learning some fancypants animation techniques. However, I ordered a thick book to help with that from Amazon that should arrive shortly.

This part of DBC is becoming the "slog", as in there's just a lot of tasks to get *done*. Whether that's reading or building or watching videos or getting enough sleep. This is the section that is about implementing new habits and building the 'muscle memory' to cement them. At least that how I feel today.
