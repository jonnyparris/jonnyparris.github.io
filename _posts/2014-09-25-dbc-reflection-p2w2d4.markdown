### Feels
Working on the view today with the main priority of making it look amazing - it's good to constantly be attacking where I feel weakest. However, it does make me feel...weak. Everything seems to be taking way longer than I anticipate and each day is ending at about midnight.

I don't think I'm burning out necessarily, but I'm begining to feel like I'm not being as effective with my time. I'll try to timebox more tomorrow.
