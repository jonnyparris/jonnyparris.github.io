excerpt: <p>what am I worried about when I think about my privacy and security in a data dystopia?</p>
---

This is basically a direct copy-pasta from my private reflection notes where I was exploring my growing unease about the state of the world and my digital footprint...largely but not exclusively triggered by the not-so-subtle-sort-your-shit-out themes of [Westworld](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0475784/) Season 3 (top notch sci-fi entertainment btw).

In response to the question "what am I worried about when I think about my privacy and security in a data dystopia? What's at stake, and what can/should I be doing about it?" I made this slightly wordy list for myself.
While I'm not going to expand on any of it at length here, I'm pasting it here as a shareable point of reference as the topic pops up quite frequently with friends and colleagues.

## Principles to consider in an ever-increasingly dystopian future for freedom of information.

### Private sentiment
> purity of memory, mindful snapshots, independent conclusions, minimised exposure to targeted corporate / political manipulation

* independent reflection and thoughts - encrypted and backed up
  * book digest & reviews
* private photo & video backup
* curated music backup

### Social liberty
> ...secured through available assets & leveraged identity in order to maintain various personal privileges

* mitigated compromise of assets from inevitable and persistent digital breach targets
  * ahead-of-the-curve credential strength
  * isolated credentials
* secured leveraged identity credentials
  * health data backups (also for independent comparison)
  * backups of all official documents & attestations
* discreet leverage of privilege
  * frustrate conventional stalking attempts
  * frustrate ads, sales and marketing efforts
  * carefully monitor and control public profiles - non-repudiation options?
* secured means of trade & procurement
  * regularly monitored & sanity-checked net worth
  * access to digital anonymous cash
  * access to anonymous identity/credentials for independent passage & communication
* minimised critical external commercialised dependencies
  * acquisition and indedependent maintenance of longlasting quality physical assets
  * upskill where feasible
  * avoid debt where reasonable
* leverage & maintain independent means of transport
  * invest in personal health
  * vehicle maintenance

### Access to global truth & knowledge
> available, reliable, honest

* decentralised and encrypted internet access
  * global, reliable VPN
* access & support distributed, independent, quality journalism
* backup important content at risk of censorship

### Drill for dramatic worst-case scenarios
> because it's only a matter of time ðŸ˜±

* All backup recovery should be tested and documented
  * Who should be equipped to navigate resources in my absence?
  * facilitate a digital death protocol
* What would need to live in a Jason Bourne "grab bag"?
  * Where could you go?
  * What could you use?
  * Who could you trust?

Does any of that make sense? Too crazy? Not cautious enough? What have I missed? Feel free to comment or [get in touch](https://twitter.com/jonnyparris). I have a feeling that I'll be referring back to this brief post regularly for one reason or another in the coming years.
