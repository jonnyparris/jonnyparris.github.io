My name is Ruskin, and I'm learning to code. That learning journey has been on and off for a few years but recently got a jumpstart as I enrolled at [Devbootcamp](http://devbootcamp.com/) in San Francisco.

I started this tech journal for a couple main reasons:

Firstly, regular reflections are a vital part of my learning (aka coping) process as I try to soak up the buttload of tech information/news/possibilities out there.

Secondly, I feel that I have a duty to share what I can about my journey in an effort to

  * give back to the community (and feel less like a lurking imposter!)
  * help anyone else who can benefit from the timeliness of my experiences
  * encourage anyone else who's considering learning to code to take the plunge.

Please feel free to get in touch with any feedback, questions, suggestionss or corrections to any of the content on here. Or, if you're just having a [general stalk](http://about.me/ruskin) then let me know what you think if we ever meet in person.
