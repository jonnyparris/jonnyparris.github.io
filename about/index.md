We should all be writing more.

My name is Ruskin and this is my outlet for sharing & tracking my tech-focused pursuits. I started it back in 2014 when I was getting seriously immersed in mastering coding & web development. The keys reasons back then are still relevant now:

Firstly, there's so much tech information/news/possibilities out there that I have to write things down to truly digest what I discover.

Secondly, I believe we should all share what we can about our discovery journeys in an effort to

  * help anyone else who can benefit from the timeliness of our experiences
  * give back to the community (and feel less like a lurking imposter!)
  * encourage anyone else who's considering learning to code / start that hobby / do that geeky thing to take the plunge.

Please feel free to get in touch with any feedback, questions, suggestions or corrections to any of the content on here. Or, if you're just having a [general stalk](http://about.me/ruskin) then let me know what you think if we ever meet.
